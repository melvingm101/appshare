# AppShare

AppShare is a web project where users can share and promote their own projects, ranging from the games they made to websites, or other projects!

## Getting Started

First we need to install our dependencies with `yarn` or `npm install`. Next, we can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
